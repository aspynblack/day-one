<h1>Graph 130 - Aspyn's Website</h1>
<h2>Everett Community College - Graph 130</h2>
<h3>I am pursuing an associate degree in Studio Arts.</h3>
<p>I chose this path because I have always been passionate about art and I want to develop my skills more in the studio aspect since its what I love doing the most. I wanted to persue a path where I loved doing what I'm doing and not hate my job. I want to maybe submit my own manga or even animate my own anime. Its been a dream of mine ever since I watched my very first anime when I was thireteen years old. </p>
